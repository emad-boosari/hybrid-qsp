# Hybrid Quantum State Preparation via Classical Compression and Quantum Decompression
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

A modular research framework for hybrid quantum state preparation using classical transform-domain compression techniques such as Fourier and Haar packet wavelet sparsification.

---

## Overview

Quantum state preparation is one of the central bottlenecks in many quantum algorithms. This repository explores hybrid quantum-classical strategies in which classical compression methods are applied prior to quantum encoding in order to reduce quantum resource requirements while preserving reconstruction fidelity.

The framework combines:
- classical transform-domain compression,
- sparse quantum state preparation,
- inverse quantum transformations,
- and reconstruction-fidelity analysis.

The current implementation includes Fourier-based and Haar-based hybrid quantum reconstruction workflows using Qibo quantum circuits.
