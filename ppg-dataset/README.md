# PPG Dataset

This directory is intended for storing the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals used in the numerical experiments and hybrid quantum reconstruction examples of the `hybrid-qsp` repository.

The experiments in this repository investigate how transform-domain sparsity can be exploited for hybrid quantum state preparation using classical compression and quantum decompression techniques.

## Dataset Source

The PPG signals used in this work are obtained from the publicly available:

**BIDMC PPG and Respiration Dataset**  
available through [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/bidmc/1.0.0/).

This dataset contains physiological recordings extracted from the MIMIC-II matched waveform database and includes:
- photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals,
- electrocardiogram (ECG) signals,
- impedance respiratory signals,
- respiratory annotations,
- and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation.

The recordings were acquired from critically ill patients at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA). Each recording has a duration of approximately 8 minutes and physiological waveforms are sampled at 125 Hz.

## Purpose in This Repository

In this repository, the PPG signals are used to demonstrate:

- Haar packet decomposition of biomedical signals,
- transform-domain sparsification,
- sparse quantum state preparation,
- hybrid quantum reconstruction,
- and compression-fidelity trade-offs in realistic physiological data.

The processing pipeline is:
